## Intro

Hack-Man is a retro game based upon the concept of the 80s arcade video game Pac-Man.

Hack-Man was developed to be similar to the much-loved classic Pac-Man, with three main additions:
* Hack-Man has a unique appearance, based on the Code Institute logo.
* Retro gaming music plays in the background of the game.
* The game is styled throughout with neon colours to achieve a look reminiscent of 80s gaming.

The player must control the movement of Hack-Man around the maze, eating dots and fruit to gain points. The goal is to eat every dot whilst not getting caught by the enemy/ghosts.

The player begins the game with three lives and loses one life each time Hack-Man collides with a ghost. 

The game ends when all lives are lost.

The game is completed by eating all the dots in the maze.

## Goal

- ➡️ Problem Statement
* We are required to build a retro game, with neon colours and retro 80's music, using a JavaScript framework and front-end only development.

- ➡️ Objective(s)
* Our objective was to build a copy of the 80's classic Pac-Man, with a few twists to make it our own.
* We aimed to build a copy of the Pac-Man game with correctly functioning 'Hack-Man', dots and fruit to be eaten, ghosts who kill Hack-Man on collision, scoring system and tunnelling feature, where Hack-Man can leave and re-enter the maze.

- ➡️ Target Audience
* The game is built for people who enjoy retro gaming as well as fans of the original Pac-Man.
* The game can be enjoyed by anyone.

- ➡️ Benefits
* The benefits of the game are relaxation/recreation and entertainment.

## Controls / Game Play
 
![Hack-Man Maze](assets\images\hackman-maze.png)

* The arrow keys (up, down, left and right) are used to navigate Hack-Man through the maze. 
* When Hack-Man collides with a point dot, it disappears and 10 points are added to the score. 
* When Hack-Man collides with a fruit, it disappears and 100 points are added to the score. 
* When Hack-Man collides with an enemy (ghost), 100 points are deducted from the score and one of three lives are lost. A Kaboom explosion animation appears in the  enemy position.
* Hack-Man can tunnel from one side of the maze to the other.
* On collision with a wall, the enemy will bounce away from the wall, turn randomly and continue moving.

The music added to the game are free mp3 tracks taken from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/music/). The tracks are called cruising-down-8-bit-lane, neon-gaming, last-night and stay-retro.

A spritesheet was used to source the images for the maze-wall tiles, dots, fruit and ghosts and was taken from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/arcade/pacman/).

The Hack-Man sprite was created by the development using the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) logo.
